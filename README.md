# Applied Research Innovations in Science and Engineering (ARISE)
My [NYU ARISE](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/k12-stem-education/student-programs/arise) Program Materials and Project Code from my placement at the [Chunara Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/chunaralab/) at NYU Tandon. 

My goal is to use data provided by the NHIS to look at social determinants in the spread of diseases and specifically, how they relate to someone's chances of contracting heart disease or getting a stroke. 

Another goal of mine is to become familiar with Python and the Pandas and NumPy packages to effectively make a summary of the data, such as getting the percentage of categorical variables (ethnicity, marital status), average for continuous variables(age, income, etc.), or plotting the data.
